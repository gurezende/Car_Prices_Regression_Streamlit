# Car Prices Regression Analysis

This is a complete Regression Analysis Project where I demonstrate the exploratory data analysis as well as train a Random Forest Regression model to estimate prices of cars in Brazil.

The main skills demonstrated in this project are:
* *Data Collecting*: I have collected data from the internet to create this dataset with 1352 observations. The data was collected on August, 2021.
* *Data Cleaning*: I have cleaned, parsed, formatted the data to make it ready for modeling.
* *Exploratory Data Analysis*: I have done the descriptive statistical analysis, univariated and bivariated analysis to understand the dataset.
* *Data Visualization*: Several graphics plotted (bars, boxplots, scatterplots etc
* *Data inputation*: I've inputed data using ML prediction with Random Forest from missingpy library.
* *Outliers*: I have identified and removed outliers for better performance of the model.
* *Testing and Fitting*: There are 5 models in this project and they were improved at each iterations, reaching a 95% of Explained Variance (R-Squared)
* The Project ends with a Web App created with Streamlit.
